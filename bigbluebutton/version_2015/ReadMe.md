## BigBlueButton 2015

The text was taken from https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton.github.io/blob/25582d381a27557d5e308f30a6e94a603b7438ba/_posts/2015-04-04-09architecture.md

## Assumption

For the goldstandard it was assumed, that the text fits to the same model as before.
The assumed components are: Recording Service, kurento, WebRTC-SFU, HTML5 Server, HTML5 Client, Presentation Conversion, BBB web, Redis PubSub, FSESL, Apps, Redis DB, FreeSWITCH

Notes to the goldstandard:
* note 1: kurento = webrtc Media Server https://github.com/kurento/ 
* note 2: if Flash Client !~ HTML5 Client -> remove all HTML5 Clients
* note 3: if webrtc !~ webrtc-sfu -> remove all webrtc-sfu


## Text Adaptation

* Images were removed
* Captions were kept. A finalizing dot were added.
